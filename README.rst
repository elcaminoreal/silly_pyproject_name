Silly PyProject Name
====================

This is an example application for a
multi-command
application
using
:code:`gather`.

The most important code is in:

* ``__init__.py``: This registers the :code:`ENTRY_DATA` object.
* ``__main__.py``: This is the CLI entrypoint, using :code:`ENTRY_DATA`.
* ``git.py``: This shows how to run command-line tools.
* ``name.py``: This shows how to log and support dry-run manually.
